# CKTrends

An API for tracking changes in your CloudKit database.

API code to come (already written and working in my development environment; just need to clean it up and integrate with Cocoapods)

# Privacy Policy

CKTrends--both the app and API--will not give your app's trends to 3rd parties. The Google Firebase database that tracks your app's trends has its security settings set to auth only for both read and write operations. Further, no one but you can read from or write to your part of the database.
